# Satellite-Image-Classification

## Introduction

The main purpose of this repository is to compare pre-trained neuronal networks from Keras in the classification of satellite images. My objetive will be to show in a graphical way that not all the Deep Learning models work in different situations. therefore, before sell a project we should test different architectures in order to obtain the best project possible

## Data source

The dataset used was collected from pictures that one satellite has done.

## Data description

This dataset contains 24657 images stored in 45 folders in the training path and 3080 images without storing in the test path. Each folder represents one different class or one different type of picture.

## Problem goals

Goals are the following:

- Build a good model who classifies the images in their different type
- Compare pre-trained neuronal networks from Keras

## Conclusion
